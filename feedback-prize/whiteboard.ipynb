Whether that may be many people or just one person it is usually someone we confide in with our thoughts and someone that can confide in us to be able to tell the truth. At times, we may find it better to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. We may go to one person to get an outside opinion on the situation. By getting this outside opinion this person may not necessarily be biased to one side of the story and it gives this person a chance to be truthful. You may also go to someone who has a different way of thinking as you, someone with a different mindset. This person could bring up new points to you and new sides of the situation to open up your mind to new possibilities. There might also be someone who has a similar way of thinking as you that could help you reassure and understand your thoughts and emotions. Another reason why you may go to a different person is just to vent. By simply telling this person everything thats going on it could help you organize thoughts in your own head. You may not look for this person for advice but someone to be there to listen to you while you figure out how you want to move forward in the situation.

       "That means that drivers have to stay alert. There are systems to alert a driver, but if a driver is relaxed the transition could be difficult. It would not be a completly stress free ride if a driver has to think about when they will have to take over and in what difficult situation that would be in, because drivers are expected to take over in difficult situations. &quot;Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways of dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork of accidents.&quot; When learning to drive we may reach a point that what is primarily being taught is the dificult things and when the computer stops working one would just have to get off the road or drive dangorously. Or we could reach the point that teaching people how to drive stops. Once we reach the point of not needing a human driver people become completly at the mercy of a computer and we lose the ability to drive because we don't need to know how. Computers can always malfunction and then it's not even a human at fault when people die because of it. Driving teaches control, awareness, and even patience, if a computer is doing all that those life skills are not readily learned and lost to more people.
